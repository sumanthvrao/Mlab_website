            The Microsoft Innovation lab of PES University brings together
            students interested in technology and applied sciences and helps
            them implement their ideas. It’s a platform where students are
            provided numerous learning opportunities which allow them to push
            the boundaries of technical research and build innovative products
            for the masses. The club's activities include an annual summer
            internship, a roadshow, an ideathon (Incito), a hackathon (#Code)
            and other hands-on workshops. Members are recruited through the
            summer internship. Interns often stay back to mentor the next
            generation of students, and over the years, Microsoft Innovation Lab
            has grown into family of a diverse set of students who continue to
            stay in touch with and contribute to the lab long after graduation.

          The Microsoft Innovation lab of PES University brings together
          students interested in technology and applied sciences and helps them
          implement their ideas. It’s a platform where students are provided
          numerous learning opportunities which allow them to push the
          boundaries of technical research and build innovative products for the
          masses. The club's activities include an annual summer internship, a
          roadshow, an ideathon (Incito), a hackathon (#Code) and other hands-on
          workshops. Members are recruited through the summer internship.
