An Innovation Expo organized by Microsoft Lab each year after the Summer Internship Program. An exhibit where all Microsoft Lab Summer Interns get to present their projects that they have worked on during the internship. This serves as a great platform for students from PES University to interact with the Microsoft Lab members and gain knowledge about the cutting edge technologies that we work on. Roadshow also serves as the platform where our interns receive constructive feedback from experienced professionals, professors and their peers.

Incito is the Ideathon organized by Microsoft Lab. It is a conglomerate of brilliant minds, incubating innovative ideas. The shortlisted 10 best ideas battle it out in the final round to win cash prizes upto Rs.10,000 in all. The participants test the design and feasibility of their ideas without having to implement the same, hence encouraging innovative thinking. The best ideas are also provided with the platform and resources to implement their projects and bring their ideas to life.
